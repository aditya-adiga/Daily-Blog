# New Beginnings ![NEW BEGINNINGS](https://www.phillipsfamilylaw.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/New-Beginnings--scaled.jpg)

So after my last blog i had to go through 3 days of intense but short study sessions for my internals. I have a bad habit of studying at the end moment cause that gives me some kinda thrill.Sometimes you just cant finish it so end up missing 3 tests in total.
Like you guys know i was pretty frustrated the last time i wrote a blog and that frustration and irritation continued fro few days after the internals but then i came to  a conclusion- "I cannot change what's already done so lets just have fun with the process and see how it goes."   

Like any other person who is looking for a source of motivation i was looking at a bunch of ted talks thats where i came across this one ted talk called the first 20 Hours: [20 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY)
It included the story of roger fedrer who explored so many different things before he became a professional tennis player that got me thinking me being a person full of curiosity with a short attention span is also doing the same shit.I'm trying different stuff to try and see what i like. It really got me inspired so i decided to take things into my own hands and decide that i will no more care what others think or care but focus on my path to success. I wanna go for an MS then im gonna do that.
The ted talk also mentioned about a 20 hour rule which basically says that it takes about 20 hours of dedicated focus to get good at something.For someone like me with a good grasping power it seemed intrestinga nd worth experimenting.
So i have decided around 6 things that i want to get good at by the end of next 30 days. Giving around 5 hours a day should make that possible based on the calculations.

The list includes a bunch of technical stuff that i want to explore and get good at.So lets see how it goes.

Yeah now that i remember i am performing a live music session today at a bistro nearby at an open mic event.I'll be performing 3 songs:

1. [ehsas by myself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afBX-3RcZ4)
2. [love yourself by justin beiber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyEuk8j8imI)
3. [chaand baaliyan by aditya a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3-Gei5j4w)

Hopefully it goes fine.
