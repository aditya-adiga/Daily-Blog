# FUCK IT!!
Enough is enough is what I said, After the most hectic week that I had. With so many assignments,Projects,Submissions,Hakcathon and an Interview.   

## Hackathon

Ok so it started with the hackathon that i participated in, which was organised in our college, And yes i fucked it up along with my teammates because of some disagreements and misunderstandings and we lost it pretty badly as we could not get the prototype ready by the end of the event.No sleep and dissapointment not a good combination kinda puts you on the edge with anger.This event was tied with a company called Sahaj and they had done this to do recruit candidates from our campus.Even though our team messed up pretty badly i still was givena shot at the Interview which got me pretty excited as i really enjoyed the company's policies and work cultutre and the poeple working there,So i was pretty hyped about this.

## Interview

So the interview was pretty intresting it was a leading interview where my the work i have previously done was not analysed based on some stupid resume but by analysing my knowledge through a bunch of questions which were based on something i have told previously.So i started off talking about the decentralised chat system i had built and then the interview led into the underlying architecture of the technologies that was used during the implementation of the same.I really enjoyed the conversation as the whole thing was based on something of my intrest.L there were questions related to algorithms,dbms and networks which i answered to the best of my knowledge. Considering all of this together i was expecting some kinda callback or lets say a positive response from the company, but guess what things never go the way you want it to ,so i did not make the cut.So this kinda pissed me off cause im very bad at taking rejections because of how competative i am. But now that i think of it i feel like i can improve at a bunch of places so i have decided to get in contact with my interviewers and see if i can get any feedback from their end to improve myself and make myself a better version unlike microsoft windows 11.

## Submissions
This was follwed by this week which was full of submissions which was so irritating cause i had to submit assignment for finance where i had to write like around 48 pages of assignment which pisses me off why cant they just give projects or case studies instead of these stupid assignments? We can learn way more that way.Anyway this was followed by me working on a bunch of projects like Artifical intelligence,Image processing,Web applications, Networks and so on which are quite intresting but then again hectic as we need to document everything and have everything right,But way better than assignments!!

## Internals
Now this is followed by the stupid internals for which i study only a day before and i have them tommorow so i need to start studying for them ............

## Projects
I am working on a bunch of projects right now, have a lot of commitment but i have been procrastinating a lot lately.It pissed me off too much so i have decided to start this blog like this where i will be updating my work so i can keep my progress in check and myself on track.

### Sayonara till next time.
